 -sometimes a pair of small roids won't die until some other roid gets killed, then they vanish
 -it's possible for a roid to get hit near vertically when it's passing through the top or bottom, which results in a pair that stay offscreen for a long time
 -audio latency
 -ball gets to a very steep angle and there's no gameplay for a long time
 -sound effects stop playing after a while
